# Binance EMA36 Analysis Script

## Overview

This script uses [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) to fetch the latest 4-hour OHLCV data from Binance for a specified set of cryptocurrency pairs. It then applies a 36-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) calculation using the [ta](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) library. By comparing each coin’s latest closing price to its 36-period EMA, the script identifies which coins are currently trading below their EMA36.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Fetching:** Leverages `ccxt` to connect to Binance’s API and retrieve up-to-date pricing data.
- **Technical Analysis Integration:** Uses `ta.trend.EMAIndicator` to efficiently compute EMA values.
- **Easy Configuration:** Modify the `top_36_coins` dictionary to track your desired markets.
- **Actionable Insights:** Instantly see which coins are trending below a critical moving average, informing your trading or monitoring strategies.
